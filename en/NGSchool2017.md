Assuming you start from clean Ubuntu 16.04.

> **Note: **If you use VirtualBox and want to enable copy-paste between host and virtual machine, you need to download and install VirtualBox Guest Additions from Devices menu. After that reboot and click Devices -&gt; Shared Clipboard -&gt; Bidirectional.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Run again upgrade to see if all the packages are installed:

```bash
aln@aln-vb:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Calculating upgrade... Done
The following packages have been kept back:
  linux-generic-hwe-16.04 linux-headers-generic-hwe-16.04
  linux-image-generic-hwe-16.04
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded.
```

If the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the upgrade then that will be listed as ["kept-back"](https://debian-administration.org/article/69/Some_upgrades_show_packages_being_kept_back). In our case kernel images need to be upgrade, which can be solved with:

```bash
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

If we run upgrade again we can see that everything is ok:

```bash
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

Let's say we need to install R \(we can even try to search package name if we don't know it\):

```bash
apt-cache search r | grep statistic
sudo apt-get install r-base-core r-recommended
```

> Always use **sudo** over **su**: only particular command will run as super-user; you will be asked for your password, so you can think twice before executing; attempts to invoke sudo can be logged.

Let's run R:

```bash
aln@aln-vb:~$ R

Wait, but we need the latest version, which is 3.4, why do we have 3.2 \(it can happen with many packages and versions\)? Didn't we update the system properly? Let's check the metadata of the package within Ubuntu repository:

```
apt-cache show r-base
```

We can also look at the version table as well:

```
apt-cache policy r-base
```
