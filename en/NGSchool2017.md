Assuming you start from clean Ubuntu 16.04.

> **Note: **If you use VirtualBox and want to enable copy-paste between host and virtual machine, you need to download and install VirtualBox Guest Additions from Devices menu. After that reboot and click Devices -&gt; Shared Clipboard -&gt; Bidirectional.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Run again upgrade to see if all the packages are installed:

```bash
aln@aln-vb:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade
Reading package lists... Done

The following packages have been kept back:
  linux-generic-hwe-16.04 linux-headers-generic-hwe-16.04
  linux-image-generic-hwe-16.04
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded.
```

If the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the upgrade then that will be listed as ["kept-back"](https://debian-administration.org/article/69/Some_upgrades_show_packages_being_kept_back). In our case kernel images need to be upgrade, which can be solved with:

```bash
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

If we run upgrade again we can see that everything is ok:

```bash
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```





```cpp
// my first program in C++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
}
```
